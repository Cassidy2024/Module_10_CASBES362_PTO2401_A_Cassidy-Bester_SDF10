## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An Application Programming Interface (API) allows software applications to communicate with one another and communicates users requests in a way the server can understand.APIs aare significant in
software development as it allows software to be used across different platforms without building the functionality from scartch, It protects parts of a system that should not be accesiable to a user by only expossing certain parts of the system and API's allow for data sharing.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface is a broader term whereby interaction is made between two systems such as devices and users.
An API focuses on software to software interaction.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

The main components of APIs are:
-Endpoints: This is a path where API related functions can be accessed and it represents the APIs various functionalities.
-Methods: HTTP functions such at GET PUT POST that define the actions that can be executed against the APIs endpoint.
-Data formats: specific formats that allow both clients and servers to read and understand data exchanged (eg,JSON and XML)
Types of APIs:
-Web APIs are interfaces that operate over the internetand and facilitate interactions between system and the web servers hosting them.
-RESTful APIs organise data into specific uniform resource identifiers(URIs)
-Public APIs are available to users with minimal restrictions and can be freely accessed by anyone.
-Private APIs are restricted and have limited access, these are often used internally within companies.
-Operating system APIs provide a bridge for software applications to request and carry out basic operations within an operationg system.
-Library and Framework APIs eliminate the need to write code for basic repetitive tasks as it provides predefined function to aid application development.
-Database APIs enable communication between an application and a database allowing for data manipulation
-Hardware APIs allow software to interact, control and retrieve data from hardware devices like from external components such as printers

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs?

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?
